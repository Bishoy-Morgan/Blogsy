    <!-- HERO -->
    <div class="mb-5">
        <h1>Blogsy is a calm place for writing and reading</h1>
        <p class="subtitle mt-3 text-gray">
            Built for people who care about ideas, clarity,
            and thoughtful conversations — not engagement tricks.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- WHY -->
    <div class="mb-5">
        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Why Blogsy exists</h3>
        <p class="text-gray">
            Most writing platforms today optimize for speed, metrics,
            and constant scrolling. Blogsy takes a different approach.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray">
            The goal is simple: give writers a focused space to publish,
            and readers a clean way to discover ideas worth spending time on.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- PRINCIPLES -->
    <div class="mb-5">
        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Product principles</h3>

        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li class="mb-3">
                <strong>Clarity over complexity</strong>
                <p class="font-11 text-gray mt-1">
                    Features exist only if they improve the writing or reading experience.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li class="mb-3">
                <strong>Human-scale social features</strong>
                <p class="font-11 text-gray mt-1">
                    Following, claps, and comments are designed to support creators —
                    not turn writing into a competition.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li class="mb-3">
                <strong>Built as a real product</strong>
                <p class="font-11 text-gray mt-1">
                    Blogsy is developed with production-ready architecture,
                    modular code, and long-term maintainability in mind.
                </p>

    <!-- BUILDER -->
    <div class="mb-5">
        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Built as a hands-on product</h3>
        <p class="text-gray">
            Blogsy is an independent project built to demonstrate real-world
            product thinking — from UX decisions to backend structure,
            performance considerations, and scalability.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray">
            Every feature is intentionally scoped, implemented,
            and refined with real usage in mind.
        </p>
    </div>
